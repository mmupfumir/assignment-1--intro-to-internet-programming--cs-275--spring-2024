  <section id="principle2">
      <h2>Principle 2: Good Design Makes a Product Useful</h2>

  <section id="principle10">
      <h2>Principle 10: Good Design is as Little Design as Possible</h2>
      <p>Less, but better because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials...</p>
